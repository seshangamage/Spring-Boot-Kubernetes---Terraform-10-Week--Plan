Below note explains how the deployemnt file works

apiVersion: apps/v1

This tells Kubernetes which API version you’re using.
apps/v1 is the version for Deployments in modern Kubernetes.

🔹 kind: Deployment
This YAML creates a Deployment, which:
    Manages pods for you
    Ensures the desired number of pods are always running
    Handles rolling updates
    Restarts failed pods

🔹 metadata
    metadata:
        name: springboot-app

Metadata includes identification information.
Here, the Deployment is named springboot-app.

🔹 spec
    This is where you define how the Deployment should behave.

        1️⃣ replicas
                replicas: 2
        Kubernetes will run 2 identical pods of your Spring Boot app.
        If 1 crashes → it will recreate another automatically.

        2️⃣ selector
                selector:
                    matchLabels:
                        app: springboot-app

        Selector tells Kubernetes which pods this Deployment will manage.
        It uses labels to match.

        3️⃣ template
        This describes the pod template — what each pod should look like.

            template:
                metadata:
                    labels:
                        app: springboot-app
        Every pod created will have the label:app: springboot-app
        This must match the selector.

        4️⃣ pod spec & container
        spec:
            containers:
                - name: springboot-app
                  image: your-dockerhub-username/springboot-microservice:1.0
                  ports:
                    - containerPort: 8080

        Key points:
            Container name
                Helps identify the container inside the pod.

            Image
                Points to your Docker image in Docker Hub.
                Example:
                    seshangamage/springboot-microservice:1.0

        Container port
            Exposes port 8080 inside the container
            (Spring Boot default port)
            This does NOT expose it outside the cluster — for that you need a Service.We will be using the springboot-service.yaml file
